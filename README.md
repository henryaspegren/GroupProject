# Group Project

# Setup for Python portion
1) install pip and virtualenv. Pip allows you to install python
dependencies and virtualenv is a virtual environment manager that 
makes synchronizing across platforms easy.

2) create a virtual environment where the 
 python project can live

$ virtualenv virt
$ source virt/bin/activate

3) now install all the required dependencies (foolproof!)

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

4) when you want to leave the virtualenvironment 
just run 

$ deactivate
